# Password Manager/Encryption with Python

## Welcome!

This is a simple password manager/encryption tool built using Python.

The program starts by asking for a master code <span style=' color:teal'>**0xNone2Deep**</span>, which is hardcoded in the program and stored in a variable.

The program then asks for the Acount ID (Something to remember the password by) and also a Password. The Password is then encrypted and stored together with a timestamp and the Account ID in a local <span style=' color:teal'>_passlist.txt_</span> file.

<span style=' color:red'>**Note:**</span>
Make sure to install the necessary modules, if you dont have them installed already using the <span style=' color:teal'>_requirements.txt_</span> file by utilizing the `pip install -r requirements.txt` command in your terminal.

**Happy Encrypting!**
