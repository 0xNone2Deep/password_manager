# Password Manager/Encryption with Python

Welcome!
This is a simple password manager/encryption tool built using Python.

The program starts by asking for a master code <span style=' color:teal'>**0x9n2Deep**</span>, which is hardcoded in the program and stored in a variable.

Make sure to install the necessary modules, if you dont have them installed already using the _requirements.txt_ file by utilizing the **pip install -r requirements.txt** command in your terminal.

**Happy Encrypting!**
